Mir hacking guide
=================

Building mir

Mir is built using cmake. There are other options, but here's one way to
build the system:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make -j 8
  $ ctest


Coding mir

There's a coding style guide in the guides subdirectory. To build it into an
html file:

  $ make guides


Documentation

There are design notes and an architecture diagram (.dia) in the design
subdirectory.


Getting mir

If you're reading this file then you've probably solved this one. ;)

However, for completeness mir is a project on LaunchPad (https://launchpad.net/mir)
to grab a copy use the command:

  $ bzr branch lp:mir
