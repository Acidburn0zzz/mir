 * We need absolute precision here. And sadly that means std::chrono and

 *  - Graphics frame timing needs support for at least the kernel clocks
 *    CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC, to be selected at runtime.
 *  - mir::time::Timestamp is relative to the (wrong) epoch of steady_clock,
 *    so converting to/from mir::time::Timestamp would be dangerously
 *    inaccurate at best.
 *  - We need full 64-bit timestamps that match those of existing (e.g. GLX)
 *    clients that call clock_gettime.
