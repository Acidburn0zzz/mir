 * The word "Session" is overloaded and over-abstracted here. "Session" can
 * be used to represent either an application or a login. Both are sessional
 * concepts capable of creating and destroying surfaces. This seems
 * straightforward but what then is a SessionStore?
 *
 * A SessionStore is anything capable of opening and closing sessions. So by
 * the previous definition, a SessionStore could be any of:
 *  - a single login (creates App sessions, but is also a session itself)
 *  - a single seat (usually one per machine; creates login sessions)
 *
 * It seems feasible that in future someone will specialize Session and
 * SessionStore into more concrete classes like "Application", "Login" and
 * "Seat". That would be easier to comprehend, but is a job for another day.
