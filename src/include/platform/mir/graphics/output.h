 *   - Frame timing information
 *   - Sub-pixel RGB arrangement (future enhancement)
 *   - Resolution (future enhancement?)
 * Although we usually like to abstract low-level implementation details,
 * such attributes of the physical display need to be known at a high level
 * in order to render with optimal visual quality and precision.
