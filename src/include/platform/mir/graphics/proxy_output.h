 * ProxyOutput is a proxy representing any number of other outputs.
 * It returns compatible attributes that best match the whole set of its child
 * outputs. This is for use in multi-monitor scenarios where you only want
 * to render each frame once, and have it looking correct on multiple outputs.
 *
 * Presently ProxyOutput is used to implement multi-monitor frame timing.
 * In future it could also be used for calculating the best sub-pixel
 * arrangement to match differing display hardware.
