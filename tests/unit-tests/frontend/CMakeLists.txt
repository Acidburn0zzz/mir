# TODO this test is a mess - something better is needed.
# - it doesn't pass FDs between processes
# - it doesn't test that the received FD can be used
# - the code it tests [test_file_descriptors()] isn't part of the system proper
# - it touches the filesystem
# Really, it tests for a side-effect of passing an FD over a socket using libancillary.
# So, we should write an integration level test that passes FDs between
# processes and get rid of this test and test_file_descriptors()
